## 10/19/2025 - Testing how the Demo Plane flies  

I first designed prototyped my first plane protoype in cad and then built the plane in real life using Balsa wood as the main structure of the plane, foam board for the wings, steel struts for the push rods to control the control surfaces (rudder and elevator as this plane is a two channel plane). Once the plane was built, I went to my school sports hall and tested to see how the plane flew. The plane flew very well with no problems. It was very easy to control and intuitive.
